Google Homepage Project

02. 12. 2018 21:08

This is just a simple document to showcase, through self-discovery, how the model of the webpage was built, and what resources were used to create it. As an absolute beginner, this will probably have many notes by the end of the project session, and can always be referred back to by myself or others when needed.

To start off as a semi-introduction, the main basis of this project, from The Odin Project, is to create a replica of either the Google Homepage - easy - or a Google Search Engine - hard. The Odin Project's main goal and idea behind this project is to learn about HTML and CSS through self discovery and independent learning. The website has supplied users with little or no resources to use to create the website, only a few rules and regulations to follow. It is up to us to create the homepage, finding any worthy or useful information on the web to create it.

Skills the Odin Project considered helpful to learn and know how to do before starting the project:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the webpage
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the webpage
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage.
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a webpage
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form - even if it doesn't go anywhere

All of these skills and learned information will be recorded in the next and upcoming updates on the file...
